Azure GoLang Site Extension
============================

This repository holds all the bits and assets used to create the [Go Lang for Azure Websites](https://www.siteextensions.net/packages/golang/) site extension. It also includes an Azure Resource Manager [resource template](https://github.com/wadewegner/azure-go-lang-site-extension/blob/master/scripts/Template.json) and [PowerShell script](https://github.com/wadewegner/azure-go-lang-site-extension/blob/master/scripts/Deploy.ps1) to automate the creation of an Azure Website and installation of the site extension.

For full details, please see my post [Creating a Go Site Extension and Resource Template for Azure](http://www.wadewegner.com/2015/01/creating-a-go-site-extension-and-resource-template-for-azure/).
